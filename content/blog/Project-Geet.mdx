# Geet: Building a Music Streaming App Focused on Friends, Collaboration, and Emotion

**Phase 1 — Idea, Vision, and Project Initialization**

## Introduction

Music has always been more than sound. It carries emotions, memories, and connections. Yet, most music streaming platforms focus on **individual consumption**, even though music is often experienced **together** — during trips, events, late-night calls, or shared moments with friends and partners.

This gap led to the birth of **Geet**.

Geet is not just a music streaming app. It is a platform designed to **listen together**, **collaborate on playlists**, and **share emotions through music**, while staying technically efficient and scalable.

This first blog documents:

* Why Geet exists
* What problem it tries to solve
* The initial technical and product vision
* How Phase 1 of the project was initialized

## The Problem With Existing Music Streaming Platforms

Most popular music apps today are optimized for:

* Individual listening
* Algorithm-driven discovery
* Passive consumption

What they lack:

* True collaborative listening
* Shared playlist ownership
* Synchronized listening experiences
* Event-based or relationship-based music workflows

For example:

* Friends planning a road trip
* Couples creating a playlist for an anniversary
* Groups listening together remotely
* Karaoke-style lyric experiences

These experiences are either poorly supported or entirely missing.

## The Core Idea Behind Geet

Geet is designed around **human connection**, not just content delivery.

The core principles are:

1. Music should be **shared**, not isolated
2. Playlists should be **collaborative**, not owned by one person
3. Listening together should feel **natural and synchronized**
4. Infrastructure should be **efficient and cost-aware**

Geet aims to bring back the **social layer of music**.

## What Geet Is (At a High Level)

Geet is a collaborative music streaming mobile application where users can:

* Listen to music individually or together
* Create shared playlists for events, trips, or relationships
* Collaborate on playlists with friends
* Listen in real time or asynchronously
* Use lyrics for karaoke-style singing
* Request unavailable music and get notified when it’s ready

All of this is designed while keeping **server load minimal** and **storage usage optimized**.

## Phase 1: Project Initialization

**Timeline:** Project Start — Phase 1

Phase 1 focuses on **foundation**, not features.

### Goals of Phase 1

* Define the product scope clearly
* Finalize core architecture direction
* Set technical constraints
* Prepare repository structure
* Choose licensing and documentation standards
